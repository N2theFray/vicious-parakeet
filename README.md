# Week 3 UCF coding project

This weeks project was to create a password generator that was able to output a selection of desired contents i.e. uppercase, lower case, special, or numeric characters

This was our first foray into javascript and I found it to be appropriately challenging given the scope of this bootcamp. To give you most of the knowledge, force you to research, independent study, and enhance troubleshooting skills.

Most of the project went smoothly once I got the ball rolling. I broke the tasks into small parts that i understood well, built the framework, then enhanced it incrementally through independent study. This project also gave me some insight into a little more advanced troubleshooting methods. Through use of the debugger and going incrementally through the program i was finally able to complete the task. It wound up being a invalid use of the return function, and additionally generating a function with a function.
